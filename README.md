# LANDFILL MINING PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION ACT
**LMPCP Act**

The primary goal of this model legislation is to prevent landfill mining by establishing a regulatory framework so protective and stringent that it effectively deters such operations entirely. Rather than merely regulating landfill mining, this legislation aims to make commercial landfill mining operations economically unfeasible through comprehensive protections, strict controls, and substantial community benefits requirements.

This framework recognizes that landfill mining poses grave risks to public health, environmental safety, and community well-being. In an ideal world, landfills would not need to be mined at all. Instead, resources would be recovered through circular economy practices before materials ever reach landfills, and existing landfills would be properly contained and managed as brownfields.

The legislation establishes that landfill mining should only occur in extraordinary circumstances where communities themselves choose to allow it, and then only under the most rigorous oversight with substantial benefits flowing to affected communities. By flipping the script on corporate resource extraction, this Act ensures community sovereignty over these potentially valuable but hazardous resources.
This document is intended as a template for a bill that any state can adapt and introduce as an amendment to existing landfill regulations. It establishes the basic framework for protecting communities and the environment from the potential hazards of landfill mining while ensuring appropriate oversight, penalties, and community benefits if such activities are ever proposed.

*Note:* This model legislation specifically addresses landfill mining and material extraction from waste disposal sites. States should ensure they also have comprehensive brownfields reclamation legislation in place that addresses surface remediation, monitoring, and redevelopment of contaminated sites. While related, brownfields reclamation involves different approaches and protections that should be handled through separate legislative frameworks.
