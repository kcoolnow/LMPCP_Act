Landfill mining can pose serious risks to human health, environmental stability, and community well-being. Without clear legal frameworks, these activities may proceed with inadequate safeguards, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. This model legislation seeks to prevent such outcomes by:

✅ Establishing **rigorous permitting requirements** and **environmental controls**  
✅ Ensuring **community involvement** in decision-making processes  
✅ Requiring **financial assurances** to cover long-term monitoring and remediation  
✅ Enforcing **strict penalties** for violations and non-compliance  
✅ Providing **accessible information** through plain language materials
