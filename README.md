## **Why This Matters**

Landfill mining can pose serious risks to human health, environmental stability, and community well-being. Without clear legal frameworks, these activities may proceed with inadequate safeguards, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. This model legislation seeks to prevent such outcomes by:

‚úÖ Establishing **rigorous permitting requirements** and **environmental controls**  
‚úÖ Ensuring **community involvement** in decision-making processes  
‚úÖ Requiring **financial assurances** to cover long-term monitoring and remediation  
‚úÖ Enforcing **strict penalties** for violations and non-compliance  
‚úÖ Providing **accessible information** through plain language materials

## **How to Use This Repository**

State legislators, policymakers, environmental advocates, and community organizers can use this model legislation to:

* Adapt and introduce it as a bill in state legislatures.  
* Strengthen existing landfill regulations with its provisions.  
* Educate communities about their rights and protections.  
* Develop advocacy campaigns to prevent unsafe landfill mining practices.
