# **Landfill Mining Prevention Act:**  **WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU**

## **Why This Matters—Protecting Our Communities**

*Landfills aren't just trash piles—they're potential hazards that require careful management. For decades, our communities have lived with these sites, and now some corporations view them as profit opportunities rather than the environmental liabilities they truly are. Scientific research shows disturbing landfills could release dangerous heavy metals, toxic dust, and contaminants into our water, our air, and our neighborhoods for generations. The Landfill Mining Prevention Act puts communities first by creating a framework so protective that it effectively prevents landfill mining except in extraordinary circumstances where communities themselves choose to allow it. This legislation says no to corporate exploitation and puts us in charge of our environmental future.*

**The Truth About Landfill Mining**

* Mining landfills is fundamentally risky and rarely justifiable from a public health perspective  
* Groundbreaking research from the University of Nottingham shows dangerous levels of heavy metals and significant cancer risks from landfill disturbance  
* Most landfills are best managed through containment, monitoring, and brownfields approaches  
* This law empowers communities to prevent mining operations, not just regulate them

## **UNDERSTANDING YOUR RIGHTS TO PREVENT LANDFILL MINING**

This guide helps you understand how the Landfill Mining Prevention Act empowers you to protect your community. The key difference from other regulations: this law is designed to stop landfill mining, not facilitate it.

### **What you can do:**

* **Test your water now:** Establish baseline water quality data  
* **Map water resources:** Help document all wells, springs, and water bodies near the landfill  
* **Research historical contamination:** Learn if your landfill has a history of leaching
