# **LANDFILL MINING PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION ACT (LaMPCoP Act)**

## **SUMMARY**

The primary goal of this model legislation is to **prevent landfill mining** by establishing a regulatory framework so protective and stringent that it effectively deters such operations entirely. Rather than merely regulating landfill mining, this legislation aims to make commercial landfill mining operations economically unfeasible through comprehensive protections, strict controls, and substantial community benefits requirements.

This framework recognizes that landfill mining poses grave risks to public health, environmental safety, and community well-being. In an ideal world, landfills would not need to be mined at all. Instead, resources would be recovered through circular economy practices before materials ever reach landfills, and existing landfills would be properly contained and managed as brownfields.

The legislation establishes that landfill mining should only occur in extraordinary circumstances where communities themselves choose to allow it, and then only under the most rigorous oversight with substantial benefits flowing to affected communities. By flipping the script on corporate resource extraction, this Act ensures community sovereignty over these potentially valuable but hazardous resources.

This document is intended as a template for a bill that any state can adapt and introduce as an amendment to existing landfill regulations. It establishes the basic framework for protecting communities and the environment from the potential hazards of landfill mining while ensuring appropriate oversight, penalties, and community benefits if such activities are ever proposed.

Note: This model legislation specifically addresses landfill mining and material extraction from waste disposal sites. States should ensure they also have comprehensive brownfields reclamation legislation in place that addresses surface remediation, monitoring, and redevelopment of contaminated sites. While related, brownfields reclamation involves different approaches and protections that should be handled through separate legislative frameworks.

## **CONTEXT/WHEREAS**

*Note: This section can be strengthened by adding state-specific context on existing landfills, environmental justice concerns, and current waste management practices.*

***Whereas,*** landfill mining poses significant risks to public health, environmental safety, and community well-being through the disturbance of previously contained waste materials;

***Whereas,*** scientific research, including studies from the University of Nottingham, has demonstrated dangerous levels of heavy metals, air quality hazards, and elevated cancer risks associated with landfill mining operations;

***Whereas,*** ideally and moving forward, materials should be captured and reused through circular economy practices, eliminating the need for landfill mining altogether;

### Zero Waste Context

This legislation is designed to address materials that have already been landfilled, while recognizing that the optimal approach is to prevent materials from entering landfills in the first place. States adopting this Act should view it as one component of a comprehensive zero waste strategy that prioritizes:

1. Policies that encourage producers to design products for the environment  
2. Programs that significantly reduce waste generation  
3. Systems that maximize material recovery through reuse, repair, recycling, and composting  
4. Infrastructure that processes discarded materials as resources rather than waste  
5. Economic incentives that drive circular material flows  
6. Education initiatives that promote waste prevention and material conservation  
   While this Act establishes stringent requirements for landfill mining operations, its broader intent is to protect communities while encouraging a transition toward systems that eliminate the need for landfills or landfill mining in the future.

***Whereas,*** landfills represent a form of commons, funded and hosted by communities, and should not be exploited for private profit without extraordinary protections and community consent;

***Whereas,*** economic pressures and resource scarcity may lead to increased interest in landfill mining despite these risks;

***Whereas,*** communities near landfills often bear disproportionate environmental and health burdens and have historically been excluded from decisions affecting their well-being;

***Whereas,*** existing natural resource mining regulations are inadequate to address the unique challenges and risks of landfill material extraction;

***Whereas,*** proactive legislation is needed to prevent landfill mining or ensure proper oversight and protections before landfill mining proposals emerge;

***Whereas,*** meaningful community participation requires accessible information, resources to understand complex technical and regulatory matters, and ultimate authority over decisions that affect community health;

***Whereas,*** long-term environmental and health protections must be secured through robust financial guarantees that extend beyond operational periods;

***Whereas,*** emergency preparedness and response capabilities must be established before any disturbance of waste materials occurs;

***Whereas,*** transparency and accountability are essential for protecting public health and environmental quality;

***Now, therefore,*** be it enacted by the legislature of the state of \[State name\]:

## **I. LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

### **Purpose and Scope**

FOR the purpose of:

1. Establishing that landfill mining presents significant public health, environmental, and social risks that should be avoided, and that such operations should not be permitted except under extraordinary circumstances with explicit community consent and comprehensive protections  
2. Establishing landfill mining as a distinct category separate from natural resource extraction  
3. Creating a comprehensive framework of protections and requirements so stringent that they effectively deter most landfill mining proposals, while ensuring that any operations deemed necessary by communities are conducted with maximum safeguards, including:  
   1. Clear implementation and administrative authority  
   2. Rigorous technical and environmental standards, including climate impact assessment as detailed in Section II.F  
   3. Robust financial mechanisms and protections  
   4. Strong community protection provisions  
   5. Comprehensive emergency response requirements  
   6. Transparent reporting and documentation systems  
   7. Accessible information and community engagement  
   8. Effective enforcement and accountability measures  
4. Ensuring substantial community benefits and environmental safeguards where operations are permitted  
5. Setting clear penalties and enforcement mechanisms  
6. Protecting vulnerable communities from exploitation  
7. Creating pathways for meaningful community participation and authority in decision-making  
8. Establishing long-term financial responsibility for site restoration and monitoring  
9. Ensuring information accessibility and transparency throughout all processes

### **Guiding Principles**

This legislation is guided by the following principles:

1. **Prevention First:** Landfill mining should be viewed as a last resort, with preference given to brownfields reclamation approaches that stabilize and contain these sites rather than disturbing their contents. Prevention of landfill mining, except in extraordinary circumstances, is the primary goal of this legislation.  
2. **Precautionary Principle:** In the face of uncertain risks to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.  
3. **Environmental Justice:** No group of people should bear a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences, and all people should have meaningful involvement in the development and enforcement of environmental laws and policies.  
4. **Community Sovereignty:** Affected communities must have the ultimate authority to approve or reject landfill mining proposals, with meaningful opportunities to participate in decisions that affect their health, environment, and quality of life, and with resources to support informed participation.  
5. **Polluter Pays Principle:** Those who produce pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment.  
6. **Intergenerational Equity:** Present generations should ensure that the health, diversity, and productivity of the environment are maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations.  
7. **Transparency and Accountability:** All aspects of landfill mining operations, from permitting through closure, should be transparent to the public, with clear lines of accountability.  
8. **Financial Responsibility:** Financial assurance must be sufficient to address all potential environmental and public health impacts throughout the operational period and for decades beyond closure.  
9. **Information Accessibility:** Technical and regulatory information must be made accessible to all community members regardless of education level, language background, or technical expertise.  
10. **Commons Protection:** Landfills represent a form of public commons that should not be exploited for private profit without extraordinary community benefits and protections.  
11. **Zero Waste Hierarchy:** This legislation recognizes the Zero Waste International Alliance's hierarchy of highest and best use, which prioritizes waste prevention, reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting over landfilling or incineration. While this Act addresses the management of materials already landfilled, it acknowledges that preventing waste from entering landfills in the first place represents the optimal approach.  
12. **Materials Conservation:** The conservation of materials and resources should be prioritized through comprehensive strategies that address the entire life cycle of products and materials. The need to mine landfills represents a systemic failure in our materials management system that should be remedied through upstream solutions rather than relying on extraction of buried resources.  
13. **Circular Economy Complementarity:** This legislation should be implemented as part of a comprehensive circular economy framework that keeps materials at their highest value through extended product lifespans, reuse, repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. Landfill mining should be considered only when all efforts to recirculate materials through the economy have been exhausted.  
14. **Complementary Legislation Support:** States adopting this Act are strongly encouraged to implement complementary comprehensive waste prevention, reduction, and diversion legislation that addresses the root causes of waste generation. This includes extended producer responsibility, product stewardship programs, organic waste diversion, and other policies that reduce reliance on landfills.  
15. **Systems Approach:** Material management decisions should consider full environmental, social, and economic impacts throughout the entire life cycle, from extraction and production through use and end-of-life management. Landfill mining represents an end-of-pipe solution that should be evaluated within this broader systems context.  
16. **Producer Responsibility:** This legislation recognizes that producers bear primary responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products and packaging throughout their full life cycle. Extended producer responsibility and product stewardship programs represent important complementary approaches to prevent future landfill impacts.
