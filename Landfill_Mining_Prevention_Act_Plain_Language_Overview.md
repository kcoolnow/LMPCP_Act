# **Landfill Mining Prevention Act:**  **PLAIN LANGUAGE OVERVIEW**

## **Understanding the Landfill Mining Prevention and Community Protection Act**

---

## **WHAT IS THIS LAW ABOUT?**

The Landfill Mining Prevention and Community Protection Act is a state law that:

* **Prevents** landfill mining except in extraordinary circumstances  
* Creates a framework so protective that it effectively deters most landfill mining proposals  
* Gives communities the power to veto any landfill mining proposals  
* Places public health and environmental protection above resource recovery  
* Ensures that if mining ever occurs, it happens only with extraordinary safeguards

This law exists because landfill mining poses significant risks to public health and the environment. Scientific research shows landfill mining can release dangerous levels of heavy metals, create toxic dust, and contaminate water sources. The law's primary goal is to prevent these risks by stopping landfill mining before it starts.

## **WHY PREVENT LANDFILL MINING?**

Research from the University of Nottingham and other studies have found that landfill mining:

* Can release dangerous levels of heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, and lead  
* May generate dust with concentrations three times higher than air quality standards allow  
* Creates cancer risks from chromium exposure above acceptable thresholds  
* Disturbs fine particles that can travel long distances, carrying contaminants into communities  
* Threatens groundwater and surface water with long-lasting contamination

For these reasons, this law establishes a framework that prioritizes prevention rather than simply regulating an inherently dangerous activity.

## **WHO DOES THIS LAW PROTECT?**

This law protects everyone in the state by preventing the risks of landfill mining, with special focus on:

* Anyone who lives, works, or goes to school within 5 miles of a landfill (the "Community Protection Zone")  
* Communities that already face environmental injustice and pollution burdens  
* Future generations who would be affected by contamination from disturbed landfills  
* Water sources that could be contaminated for decades or centuries  
* Public commons that belong to all of us, not private mining interests

---

## **HOW DOES THE LAW PREVENT LANDFILL MINING?**

### **1\. Community Veto Power**

* Local governments can immediately terminate any landfill mining application  
* Communities have the final say on whether projects can proceed  
* No overrides of community decisions by state agencies  
* Multiple opportunities for community rejection of proposals

### **2\. Protective Standards So Strict They Deter Mining**

* Environmental and technical requirements that few operations could feasibly meet  
* Air and water quality standards that require zero degradation  
* Immediate shutdown requirements for even minor environmental impacts  
* Operating restrictions that make most mining operations impractical

### **3\. Financial Requirements That Make Mining Unprofitable**

* Massive financial assurance requirements that must be posted upfront  
* Required community benefit share of 30% of all revenue  
* Property value guarantees for all nearby properties  
* Unlimited liability for environmental damage or health impacts  
* Decades-long financial responsibility after operations end

### **4\. Extraordinary Community Protections If Mining Ever Occurs**

* Extensive health monitoring before, during, and after operations  
* Real-time environmental monitoring with public access to all data  
* Independent community inspectors with authority to halt operations  
* Comprehensive emergency planning and immediate response requirements  
* Strong enforcement mechanisms including citizen lawsuit provisions

## **WHAT POWER DO COMMUNITIES HAVE?**

Communities have extraordinary power under this law:

* **Power to Prevent**: Local governments can veto any landfill mining proposal  
* **Power to Decide**: Community consent is required at multiple stages  
* **Power to Monitor**: Community inspectors have authority to oversee operations  
* **Power to Benefit**: If mining occurs, communities receive substantial benefits  
* **Power to Enforce**: Citizens can take legal action to enforce the law  
* **Power to Protect**: Automatic operation shutdowns if monitoring shows concerns  
* **Power to Plan**: Communities help determine final site condition and use  
* **Power of Information**: All data must be accessible and understandable

---

## **HOW DOES THE PERMIT PROCESS WORK?**

The permit process is designed to be rigorous enough that most proposals will be withdrawn or rejected:

1. **Pre-Application Phase**  
   * Extensive notification to all potentially affected people  
   * Multiple public meetings to gauge community sentiment  
   * Preliminary studies that often reveal prohibitive risks  
   * Early opportunity for community rejection  
2. **Application Phase**  
   * Comprehensive documentation requirements that are costly to prepare  
   * Health, environmental, and social impact assessments with strict standards  
   * Substantial financial guarantees that must be secured upfront  
   * Community benefit agreements negotiated with affected populations  
3. **Review Phase**  
   * Rigorous technical review with no shortcuts  
   * Extended public comment period to ensure all concerns are heard  
   * Independent verification of all claims and projections  
   * Multiple agencies involved in review  
   * Absolute community veto power  
4. **Permit Terms (If Ever Approved)**  
   * Short initial term requiring frequent reassessment  
   * Strict compliance verification for any renewal  
   * Constant monitoring and inspection  
   * Immediate revocation for violations  
   * Ongoing community oversight and approval

## **WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD OF LANDFILL MINING?**

This law encourages alternatives to landfill mining:

* **Brownfields Approach**: Containing and safely managing landfills without disturbing contents  
* **Circular Economy**: Capturing and reusing materials before they enter landfills  
* **Sustainable Resource Management**: Developing environmentally sound alternatives to virgin resource extraction  
* **Community Planning**: Converting closed landfills to beneficial uses like solar farms or nature preserves  
* **Pollution Prevention**: Addressing the root causes of waste generation

---

## **HOW IS THIS LAW ENFORCED?**

The law includes powerful enforcement mechanisms:

* Multiple agency inspections on regular schedules  
* Community Inspector Program with real authority  
* Substantial penalties for violations:  
  * Administrative penalties up to $100,000 per violation  
  * Civil penalties up to $100,000 per day per violation
