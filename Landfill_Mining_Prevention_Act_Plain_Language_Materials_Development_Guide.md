# **Landfill Mining Prevention Act: PLAIN LANGUAGE MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT GUIDE**

## **INTRODUCTION**

Effective implementation of the Landfill Mining Prevention and Community Protection Act requires that communities fully understand both the dangers of landfill mining and their power to prevent it. When communities clearly understand their rights and the protections provided by this prevention-focused law, they become empowered partners in ensuring landfills remain safely contained rather than disturbed for resource extraction.

This guide provides a framework for developing plain language materials that translate the Act's preventative purpose and comprehensive requirements into accessible information. It offers a systematic approach to creating communication tools that emphasize prevention while addressing different community needs and learning preferences.

The development of these materials should be guided by these core principles:

* Prevention messaging should be clear and consistent across all materials  
* Information must be understandable without specialized knowledge  
* Materials should be available in formats accessible to all community members  
* Content should emphasize community power to prevent landfill mining  
* Visual elements should complement text to enhance understanding  
* Community input should inform content development and refinement

The following roadmap outlines a strategic approach to developing plain language materials, beginning with foundational documents that establish the prevention framework and progressing to more specialized resources.

## **PREVENTION-FOCUSED LANGUAGE GUIDELINES**

When developing materials, use these language guidelines to maintain a consistent prevention message:

1. **Emphasize Prevention Over Regulation**  
   * Use "prevent" rather than "regulate" where possible  
   * Frame requirements as "deterrents" rather than just "protections"  
   * Describe the law as "stopping" mining rather than "managing" it  
   * Use "community power" language rather than "oversight" language  
2. **Highlight Scientific Evidence for Prevention**  
   * Reference specific studies showing risks  
   * Use concrete examples of health and environmental impacts  
   * Connect technical requirements to specific prevention goals  
   * Explain why containment is safer than disturbance  
3. **Frame Communities as Decision-Makers, Not Just Stakeholders**  
   * Use "authority" and "power" rather than just "participation"  
   * Describe "veto rights" rather than just "input opportunities"  
   * Frame community involvement as "deciding" rather than "commenting"  
   * Emphasize community sovereignty over shared resources

## **BALANCING PREVENTION WITH COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION**

When developing materials about the Landfill Mining Prevention Act, it's important to maintain a balanced approach that emphasizes both:

1. The primary goal of prevention due to significant risks and scientific evidence  
2. The recognition of community sovereignty and decision-making authority

The following guidelines will help maintain this balance:

### **Language Acknowledging Extraordinary Circumstances**

Materials should include language acknowledging that while prevention is the primary goal, there may be exceptional cases where:

* Specific landfills contain recoverable materials with extraordinary value to the community  
* Technical assessments indicate lower-than-typical risks due to unique site conditions  
* Communities have thoroughly evaluated options and made an informed decision  
* Comprehensive protections and benefits make the calculated risk acceptable to the affected community

### **Key Phrases for Balanced Communication**

Include these types of phrases in materials to maintain the balance between prevention and self-determination:

* "The law is designed to prevent landfill mining in most circumstances, while ensuring strict protections if a community ever determines a specific project is in their best interest"  
* "While scientific evidence indicates most landfill mining presents unacceptable risks, the law recognizes that communities should have the final authority to make informed decisions about their resources"  
* "Community sovereignty means both the power to prevent unwanted landfill mining and the authority to permit carefully controlled operations in extraordinary circumstances where the community determines benefits outweigh risks"  
* "The stringent requirements serve two purposes: preventing most landfill mining operations and ensuring maximum protection in the rare cases where communities choose to allow mining"

### **Framing Community Decision-Making**

When discussing the community's role, emphasize:

* The importance of fully informed consent based on complete information  
* The community's authority as the ultimate decision-maker, not external entities  
* The need for inclusive decision processes that involve all affected populations  
* The law's role in ensuring communities have the tools, resources, and protection to make these decisions

### **Suggested Section for Plain Language Materials**

Consider including a section in plain language materials titled "Community Authority and Informed Decisions" that explains:

* The scientific evidence that makes prevention the default position  
* The circumstances under which communities might consider allowing carefully controlled operations  
* The process for thoroughly evaluating risks and benefits  
* The protections and guarantees required before any operations could be considered  
* The community's ongoing authority throughout any approved process

This balanced approach ensures the materials accurately reflect both the prevention-focused nature of the law and the respect for community sovereignty and self-determination that is at its core.

## **IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS**

Effective implementation of this prevention-focused communication framework requires:

1. **Proactive Development**: Create prevention materials before any mining interest emerges  
2. **Community Empowerment**: Involve community members in prevention strategy development  
3. **Prevention Expertise**: Utilize technical experts who understand prevention mechanisms  
4. **Consistent Messaging**: Maintain clear prevention focus across all materials  
5. **Multiple Distribution Channels**: Ensure prevention materials reach all community segments  
6. **Integration with Local Government**: Equip local officials with prevention tools and knowledge  
7. **Training for Prevention Leaders**: Build local capacity for prevention organizing  
8. **Adequate Funding**: Allocate sufficient resources for prevention network development

By following this roadmap and these recommendations, implementing agencies and communities can ensure that the Landfill Mining Prevention and Community Protection Act achieves its primary goal of preventing landfill mining while providing comprehensive protections in the rare cases where communities might choose to allow it.
